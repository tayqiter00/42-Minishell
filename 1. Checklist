TO-DO:
1.	Handle signals: ctrl-C, ctrl-D, ctrl-\ (functions needed alr written)
2.	Error handling - especially exit status of child processes (functions needed alr written)
3.	Pipes and I/O stream redirection (Need 1, 2 and 4)
4.	Builtins (all done except exit, unset, export)
5.	Makefile

COMPLETED:
1.	Quotes and escapes
2.	Envn var expansions, including $?
3.	Read from heredoc and append to tokenlist
4.	Some builtins: echo, pwd, env, cd (cd is 80% completed)


IDEA:
Tokenlist popped off to create cmdlist separated by Pipes
Cmdlist is further split into redireactions list and a cleaned-cmdlist
Get fds of infile and outfile
Create pipe if needed
Save an original copy of the STDIN/STDOUT.
dup2 STDIN to infile if needed.
Fork.
Child process dup2 STDOUT to outfile or pipe write_end. outfile overrides pipe.
Parent process waits, closes write_end of pipe; dup2 STDIN to read_end of pipe and close.
